I am a Director and AI Lead in the Digital Sciences & Translational Imaging group within [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/) R&D. I am interested in medical imaging, machine learning, and drug R&D.

I received a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/), a Master's degree in Computer Science (specialization in Machine Learning) from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), and a PhD from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). My PhD thesis focused on cancer imaging:

>[MRI in Cancer: Improving Methodology for Measuring Vascular Properties and Assessing Radiation Treatment Effects in Brain](https://doi.org/10.7936/K7SX6CN1)

During my PhD, I did an internship at [Schlumberger](https://www.slb.com/), where my research focused on spin physics simulation and virtual prototyping for oil well logging.  

Following PhD, I did my postdoctoral research on cardiovascular imaging at [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](https://www.bidmc.org/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). Before I joined Pfizer in 2019, I had a stint at [Invicro](https://invicro.com/), working as a Study Director to support imaging programs for pharma/biotech clients.

I currently lead the development, validation, and deployment of novel AI-based solutions to support drug development programs across therapeutic areas at Pfizer. Some recent projects are:

- A fully automated AI system for analyzing echocardiography videos. This project won Pfizer's Breakthrough Science & Innovation award in 2021, the highest honor that can be bestowed to an R&D colleague.
  - [Paper](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpheart.00208.2022)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/pfizer-opensource/mouse-echo-neural-net)
  - [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/pfizers-echocardiography-analysis-framework-reduces-time-by-92-using-aws/)

- Using AI to assess solid tumor treatment response in clinical trials and unlock novel endpoints for early decision making that can accelerate drug discovery and development, in collaboration with [Vysioneer](https://www.vysioneer.com/)  
  - [ESMO 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2023.09.2452)

- Predicting PD-(L)1 response using a deep learning biomarker with routine baseline CT scans, in collaboration with [Onc.AI](https://onc.ai/)  
  - [ASCO 2024](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2024.42.16_suppl.102)  
  - [Press Release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240530243565/en/Onc.AI-to-Present-Collaboration-Results-Demonstrating-Immunotherapy-Response-Prediction-Using-a-Radiomic-Signature-in-Late-Stage-Lung-Cancer)  
 
I am also representing Pfizer in multiple public-private parternships/consortiums, including:

  - [FNIH Mucosal Healing in Ulcerative Colitis](https://fnih.org/our-programs/biomarkers-consortium-mucosal-healing-in-uc-definition-treatment-target-and-clinical-endpoints/), a public-private collaborative effort to define the best practice for measuring mucosal healing, including a machine learning method for scoring of mucosal healing that can be used in clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and clinical practice.  
  - [IHI SYNTHIA](https://www.ihi-synthia.eu/), a public-private partnership funded by the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) to revolutionize the field of personalized medicine by harnessing the power of synthetic data.
