I am the Imaging AI Lead in the Digital Sciences & Translational Imaging group within Early Clinical Development at [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/). I am interested in biomedical imaging, machine learning, and drug R&D.

I received a BSc in Chemistry from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/), an MSc in Computer Science (specialization in Machine Learning) from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), and a PhD from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). My PhD work focused on cancer imaging:

>[MRI in Cancer: Improving Methodology for Measuring Vascular Properties and Assessing Radiation Treatment Effects in Brain](https://doi.org/10.7936/K7SX6CN1)

During my PhD, I did an internship at [Schlumberger](https://www.slb.com/), where my research focused on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as applied to oil-well logging.  

Following PhD, I did my postdoctoral research on cardiovascular imaging at [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](https://www.bidmc.org/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). Before I joined Pfizer in 2019, I had a stint at [Invicro](https://invicro.com/), working as a Study Director to support drug development programs for pharma/biotech clients.

I currently lead the development of novel ML-based solutions to support drug R&D programs across therapeutic areas. We recently developed a fully automated AI system for analyzing pre-clinical echocardiography videos ([Paper](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpheart.00208.2022), [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/pfizers-echocardiography-analysis-framework-reduces-time-by-92-using-aws/)). This project won Pfizer's Breakthrough Science & Innovation award in 2021, the highest honor that can be bestowed to an R&D colleague.
